# AE-Modular-KiCAD-Template
This is a very basic KiCAD template for AE Modular modules. There are two basic projects in this repo.
- 'Panel', a simple frontpanel design.
- 'PCB', a simple pcb layout with the headers already included.

The projects are both for a 1u module, but templates for 2, 3, and 4u are included on the 'User.9' layer.
Cheers!
